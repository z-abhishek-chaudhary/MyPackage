Problem Statement:

Develop a RESTful API using Flask that can manage a list of books. The API should support CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the books in the list.
The API should allow users to add new books to the list, 
retrieve information about existing books,
update information about existing books,
and delete books from the list. Each book should have a unique identifier,
a title, an author, and a publication date.
The API should be designed in a modular and scalable way,
so that new features can be easily added in the future.
The API should also be secure and protected against unauthorized access or modifications.
To accomplish this, you will need to use Flask and SQLAlchemy to create a web application and a database.
You will need to define the endpoints for the API,
and implement the necessary functions for each endpoint to perform the desired CRUD operations on the database.

Finally, you should test the API using a tool like Postman or cURL to ensure that it is 
functioning correctly and handling all possible edge cases.
